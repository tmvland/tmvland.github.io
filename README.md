Hello! I am Theo Landman, and I coordinate the course ENGR 101 at the University of Michigan. I hold a Bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in mathematics, physics, and complex systems. My primary research interest is in the development of numerical methods for solving physical problems. I'm interested in the application of math to scientific computing and physical modeling. I love differential equations, and will talk about them at pretty much any available opportunity.
